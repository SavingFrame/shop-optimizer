# Shop Optimizer

Shop Optimizer is an application for collecting grocery prices from Croatian shops and comparing them across stores.

The goal is to make it easy to maintain a list of products, track their prices in different shops, and understand where a grocery basket is cheaper.

## What this project does

- Parses grocery product prices from Croatian shops.
- Stores products with normalized names, categories, units, and shop-specific prices.
- Compares the same or similar products across multiple shops.
- Shows price history and price charts over time.
- Helps users build a grocery list and estimate the cheapest place to buy it.

## Main use case

A user creates a list of products, for example milk, eggs, bread, rice, and coffee. The app compares available prices for those products in different Croatian shops and shows:

- which shop has the lowest price per product
- how prices changed over time
- the total basket price per shop
- where the full basket is cheapest

## Future idea

Later, the app should support uploading a grocery bill from a previous shopping trip. The app would parse the receipt, detect the purchased products, and compare how much the same basket would cost in other shops.

Example:

1. Upload last week’s grocery bill.
2. Extract products, quantities, and prices.
3. Match the products with current shop prices.
4. Show where the same basket is cheaper today.
